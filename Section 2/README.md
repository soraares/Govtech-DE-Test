## Instructions
1. Build the image from dockerfile by running `docker build -t psql:1.0 .`.
2. Run the image `docker run --name psql_image --env-file ./.env -d -p 5432:5432 psql:1.0`. The --env-file option populates the username and password of the PostgreSQL PostgreSQL from the .env file. The env file should not be uploaded to a repositary in a live environment for security reasons.
3. (Optional) Verify that PostgreSQL has been set up correctly. Run `docker exec -it psql_image bash`. This will open up as bash terminal within the container. Enter postgresql cli with `psql -U postgres` and check that the setup was executed correctly. OR Run `psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres` to access the database via the host terminal.
